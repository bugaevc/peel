# Gotchas and Pitfalls

## using namespace peel

It is often convenient to write

```cpp
using namespace peel;
```

and refer to the APIs by their natural-sounding names such as `Gtk::Button`
(instead of `peel::Gtk::Button`). We indeed recommend that you do so, and
examples in this documentation are written assuming `using namespace peel`.

There is an issue with this however, in that the `peel::GObject` namespace has
the same name as the C `GObject` type (which is known as `GObject::Object` in
peel), so any reference to `GObject` in the code following
`using namespace peel` becomes ambiguous. This is not a huge issue by itself,
since you can just use qualified names: namely, refer to the C type as
`::GObject` (and peel itself takes care to always do so), and to the peel
namespace as `peel::GObject`.

However, while your code may do this, the C headers of libraries you include
will still refer to the C type as simply `GObject`. So any `#include` of a C
header (perhaps itself coming from a peel header) following
`using namespace peel` is likely to break.

So in implementation files (`.cpp`), you should include the headers first, and
only then write `using namespace peel`. And in headers, you cannot use
`using namespace peel` at all (at least, not in the root namespace), because
some other header can always be included after yours.

C++ Core Guidelines also [warn about this](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#sf7-dont-write-using-namespace-at-global-scope-in-a-header-file):

> *SF.7: Donâ€™t write `using namespace` at global scope in a header file*

## Capturing `WeakPtr`

For [complex reasons], C++ currently lacks a way to reliably detect _trivially
relocatable_ types, that is, types whose values can be safely "moved" around
in memory without having to invoke their move constructor and destructor.
(Technically, without the standard's blessing, only primitive types are
trivially relocatable, but in practice many others are as well.)

[complex reasons]: https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/tags/#relocatability

peel sometimes uses trivial relocations when passing C++ callbacks (e.g.
lambdas) to C APIs. Specifically, if the captured data is pointer-sized (or
less) and certain other conditions are met, peel will pack the captured data
into the `gpointer user_data` argument of C functions, instead of making a
heap allocation and storing the captured data there. This is an important
optimization, and it matches what a C programmer would do when using the C API
directly. However, it relies on trivial relocation being valid for the
captured data.

Given that containg self-references (pointers to other parts of the same
object) is the primary reason for a type to _not_ be trivially relocatable,
peel is usually justified in treating pointer-sized types as trivially
relocatable: indeed, there's just no place in a pointer-sized type to contain
both the pointer and the pointee. However, there is an important type in peel
itself that is pointer-sized, yet not trivially relocatable for a different
reason, and that is [`WeakPtr`].

[`WeakPtr`]: weak-ptr.md

This means that code that only captures a single `WeakPtr` in a callback
lambda is typically broken, because of this (optimistic, but in this case,
incorrect) assumption that peel makes:

```cpp
$#include <peel/GLib/functions.h>
$
$using namespace peel;
$
Gtk::Button *button = /* ... */;

GLib::idle_add_once (
  [button = WeakPtr (button)]  /* <--- broken! */
  {
    if (!button)
      return;

    button->set_label ("New label");
  });
```

The workaround is to add another capture, perhaps of a dummy variable:

```cpp
$#include <peel/GLib/functions.h>
$
$using namespace peel;
$
Gtk::Button *button = /* ... */;

GLib::idle_add_once (
  [button = WeakPtr (button), workaround = true]
  {
    if (!button)
      return;

    button->set_label ("New label");
  });
```

Note also that Microsoft's MSVC compiler has a bug where it might parse
references to `this` inside the lambda capture list (e.g.
`self = WeakPtr (this)`) as referring to the lambda object and not an
instance of the containing class.

## Complex fields in GObject classes

GObject classes don't have a C++ constructor, instead, they have the GObject
initializer, spelled `MyType::init (Class *)` in peel. Before the initializer
is run, the body of the class is initialized to zero bytes, as if with
`memset`. This is enough to initialize many types to their default values (and
in fact similiar to how global variables located in `.bss` are initialized). In
particular:
* integers get set to 0,
* booleans get set to `false`,
* floating-point numbers get set to 0.0,
* raw pointers get set to `nullptr`,
* as an additional guarantee, peel smart pointers (such as [`RefPtr`],
  [`WeakPtr`], [`UniquePtr`], [`String`]) get set to `nullptr`.

However, for more complex types (for example, [`std::vector`]), the C++
language requires the actual constructor to be invoked. This happens implicitly
when you _do_ use a C++ constructor in your own class:

```cpp
class MyClass
{
public:
  MyClass ();
  int m_int;
  std::vector<int> m_vector;
};

MyClass::MyClass ()
 : m_int (42)
 /* m_vector implicitly constructed here */
{
  std::cout << "My C++ constructor" << std::endl;
}
```

In peel, as your class doesn't have a C++ constructor, you have to instead
explicitly use [placement new] in your initializer to construct the values of
complex types:

```cpp
class MyWidget : public Gtk::Widget
{
  /* ... */

  int m_int;
  std::vector<int> m_vector;

  inline void
  init (Class *);
};

inline void
MyWidget::init (Class *)
{
  m_int = 42;
  new (&m_vector) std::vector<int>;
}
```

On the other hand, peel classes _do_ have a C++ destructor, which is mapped to
the GObject [`finalize` vfunc]. For this reason, destructing the object will
properly destruct all of its fields, invoking their C++ destructors. You don't
have to do anything explicitly to make it happen.
